3)Evolution of E-commerce orders in the Brazil region:
      - Get the month on month no. of orders placed in each state.
      - How are the customers distributed across all the states?

4)Impact on Economy: Analyze the money movement by e-commerce by looking at order prices, freight and others.
       - Get the % increase in the cost of orders from year 2017 to 2018 (include months between Jan to Aug only).
       - You can use the "payment_value" column in the payments table to get the cost of orders.
       - Calculate the Total & Average value of order price for each state.
       - Calculate the Total & Average value of order freight for each state.

5)Analysis based on sales, freight and delivery time.
       - Find the no. of days taken to deliver each order from the orderâ€™s purchase date as delivery time.
       - Also, calculate the difference (in days) between the estimated & actual delivery date of an order.
       - You can calculate the delivery time and the difference between the estimated & actual delivery date using the given 
             formula:
            time_to_deliver = order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp
            diff_estimated_delivery = order_delivered_customer_date - order_estimated_delivery_date
       - Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average freight value.
       - Find out the top 5 states with the highest & lowest average delivery time.
        -Find out the top 5 states where the order delivery is really fast as compared to the estimated date of delivery.
        You can use the difference between the averages of actual & estimated delivery date to figure out how fast the 
         delivery was for each state.
